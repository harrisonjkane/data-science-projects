# Project Title: Housing Prices Prediction

## Overview
This repository contains a collection of data science projects focused on predicting housing prices based on various features such as location, square footage, and other property-related metrics.

In this project, I perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, and build machine learning models to predict housing prices. The project aims to demonstrate key data science skills such as data cleaning, feature engineering, model selection, and evaluation.

## Project Structure
- **__Notebooks__**: Contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, and model building.
- **__Data__**: Placeholder for datasets used in the project. (_Note: If datasets are large, they are not stored in the respository._)
- **__Scripts__**: Contains Python scripts for data loading, model training, and evaluation.
